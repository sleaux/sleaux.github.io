        <p style="text-align:justify">Hi, I'm Sean. I am a Boston, USA based software engineer focused on compiler
          testing and fuzz testing. I aspire to advance the state of the art of fuzz testing to enable more intelligent,
          more effecive testing of systems where correctness and reliability are critical. I have a grand total of 3
          (Count them, 3) personality traits, which you can find below. </p>
        <div class="col">
          <p style="text-align:justify">Engineer - I was an engineer from birth. It all started with LEGOS, which
            quickly became robotics, studying mechanical engineering in college, and most recently settling in my
            current occupation as a software engineer. I tinker with microcontrollers, 3D printers, and the occasional
            family printer that has stopped working.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p style="text-align:justify">Cat - I have a cat. Despite the fact that having pets is incredibly ordinary,
            owning a singular cat has somehow morphed into a defining characterist of myself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p style="text-align:justify">What was the third one supposed to be? I forgot. I'll have to ask my partner who
            would love to remind me. Maybe I should write "Forgetfull" instead of whatever it was suppose to be.</p>
